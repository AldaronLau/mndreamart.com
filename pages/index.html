          <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
          <p>
            I am a mixed-media experimental painter and printmaker.
            I love to learn new techniques and invent my own,
            expanding my knowledge of processes and utilizing what
            I have learned to create landscapes with a twist of reality.
            I am drawn to landscapes and making repeated images using
            different processes, mediums, colors, embellishments, and
            textures.
          <p>
            My landscapes are colorful and sometimes surreal because when I
            look at landscapes I see faces in the trees, clouds, and
            everywhere.
            I enjoy sharing what I see in my paintings so my viewers can see
            how the world looks to me.
            Oftentimes, the trunk of the trees have faces and the branches
            are arms with fingers.
          <p>
            My acrylic paintings include a variety of dimensional elements
            like texture paste, wood, glitter, fabrics, raffia, hand cut
            band-sawed wood pieces, and more.
          <p>
            I have tried just about every way there is to make prints.
            Once I made a book that used the same image but it was printed
            multiple different ways like intaglio, screen printed, laser cut,
            image transfer and many other ways.
            I recently finished another series, “Snapshot of Life,” where I
            began by drawing a landscape digitally and then cut it out onto
            an acrylic sheet with the laser cutter.
            I then painted it with watercolors 16 different ways and put it
            through the printing press to make monotype prints of the same
            image.
            I used dimensional elements to emphasize the time of day, season,
            or the stages of a forest fire.
            There were 4 sets of 4 images mounted on their own long board
            each with a theme.
            I am currently working on expanding this series into 32 dimensional
            monoprints.
